# Hangman
My first basic python learning project
Most of the files are functions defined while learning the course self.py (Cyber Israel).
The main file is Hangman.py.
After running it, the user must specify a txt file with words seperated by spaces.
The rest of the game is intuitive(follow the instuctions).
Take it easy, and enjoy the little things in life,
RoeeK
